                My name is Scott Nicholes.  My wife's name is Nellie and we just
                became parents of Echo Elizabeth Nicholes.
                My familiy is very important to me.  I love my wife and daughter very much.  I am excited to be embarking on life everyday with them.  I am committed to becoming a righteous example of a <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2016/04/fathers?lang=eng">Christlike Father</a>.

                I come from a great familiy.  I was born in Arcadia, CA and raised in Claremont, CA.  My parents are Bruce and Elizabeth Nicholes.  I have a brother and a sister.  My brother, Mike, is 31 years old.  He's currently attending the university Cal State Fullerton.  My Sister is 24 years old.  She is living in our childhood home in Claremont.

                I love roller coasters, trains, learning new languages and many other things.  A desire of mine is to go to Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio.  Cedar Point is one of the largest theme parks in the United States.  Another desire of mine is to travel to Japan and ride a shinkansen.  Shinkansen is the word for bullet train in Japanese.  I would also like to ride in a hyperloop.  A hyperloop is an extremely fast mag-lev train built inside a vaccum pipe.  It is projected that hyperloop trains will be able to travel at over 600 MPH!  Lastly, I would like to travel to Italy to visit the Rome Italy Temple.

                <h2>My Beliefs</h2>
                I believe the family is ordained of God and that the Family is central to God's plan of happiness for His children.  Associated with this is my belief that Family lies at the center of the meaning of this life.  Everything, from meeting my wife to having our daughter Echo has led back to my Family.
