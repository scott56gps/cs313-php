After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your Heroku web application:
https://prove01-hello-world.herokuapp.com/hello.html

2. Copy and paste the URL for your GitHub source code repository:
https://github.com/scott56gps/cs313-php

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
For this application, the initial page is a description of the PHP install information.

The /hello.html endpoint shows a basic HTML page that I made.  I included a stylesheet.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
None.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest part of this assignment was remembering how HTML and CSS work after a long time of not doing anything in HTML.
It was satisfying to get an application up and running on a server.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: [1-5]
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
-> 5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I believe my assignment is described by a 5 because I explored by including styles.
As was stated earlier, I have not worked with stylesheets or HTML for a while, so it was above and beyond
for me to remember how to link the stylesheet and add custom styles to a part of the text.  I investigated a
bit into the subject of styles and html on w3schools and mdn.
